                    >Ever since US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs and
                    lawless outcast Shaw first faced off, they just have swapped
                    smacks and bad words. But when cyber-genetically enhanced
                    anarchist Brixton's ruthless actions threaten the future of
                    humanity, both join forces to defeat him. (A spin-off of
                    “The Fate of the Furious,” focusing on Johnson's Luke Hobbs
                    and Statham's Deckard Shaw.)</span
