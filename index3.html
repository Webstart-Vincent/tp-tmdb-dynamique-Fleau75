                        >Simba idolises his father, King Mufasa, and takes to
                        heart his own royal destiny. But not everyone in the
                        kingdom celebrates the new cub's arrival. Scar, Mufasa's
                        brother—and former heir to the throne—has plans of his
                        own. The battle for Pride Rock is ravaged with betrayal,
                        tragedy and drama, ultimately resulting in Simba's
                        exile. With help from a curious pair of newfound
                        friends, Simba will have to figure out how to grow up
                        and take back what is rightfully his.</span
